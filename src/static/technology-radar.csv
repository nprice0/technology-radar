Spring Boot,Adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"<a href=""https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/"">Spring Boot</a>makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can ""just run"". We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring configuration."
Micro frontends,Trial,techniques,TRUE,"We've seen significant benefit from introducing microservice architectures, which have allowed teams to scale delivery of independently deployed and maintained services. However, teams have often struggled to avoid the creation of front-end monoliths-large and sprawling browser applications that are as difficult to maintain and evolve as the monolithic server-side applications we've abandoned. We're seeing an approach emerge that our teams call micro frontends. In this approach, a web application is broken up by its pages and features, with each feature being owned end-to-end by a single team. Multiple techniques exist to bring the application features-some old and some new-together as a cohesive user experience, but the goal remains to allow each feature to be developed, tested and deployed independently from others. The BFF - backend for frontendsapproach works well here, with each team developing a BFF to support its set of application features."
OWASP Dependency-Check,Assess,tools,FALSE,"<a href=""https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Dependency_Check"">Dependency-Check</a> is a utility that identifies project dependencies and checks if there are any known, publicly disclosed, vulnerabilities.  Java is supported."
React.js,Assess,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"<a href=""https://facebook.github.io/react/"">React - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces</a>"
Redux,Assess,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"With the increasing complexity of single-page JavaScript applications, we have seen a more pressing need to make client-side state management predictable. <a href=""http://redux.js.org/""><strong>Redux</strong></a>, with its <a href=""http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/ThreePrinciples.html"">three principles</a> of restrictions for updating state, has proven to be invaluable in a number of projects we have implemented. <a href=""https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux"">Getting Started with Redux</a> and <a href=""https://egghead.io/courses/building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux"">idiomatic Redux</a> tutorials are a good starting point for new and experienced users. Its minimal library design has spawned a rich set of tools, and we encourage you to check out the <a href=""https://github.com/markerikson/redux-ecosystem-links"">redux-ecosystem-links</a> project for examples, middleware and utility libraries. We also particularly like the testability story: Dispatching actions, state transitions and rendering can be unit-tested separately from one another and with minimal amounts of mocking."
Angular,Adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"We put <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/angularjs"">AngularJS</a> into the Hold ring.  We are Adopting Angular which is a rewrite, not an evolution, of AngularJS, and switching from AngularJS to Angular is not much different than switching from AngularJS to another framework.  Given the, in our experience, superior contenders such as <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/react-js"">React.js</a>, <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/ember-js"">Ember.js</a> and <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/vue-js"">Vue.js</a>, we're still hesitant to give Angular a strong recommendation. It is not a bad choice, especially if using TypeScript."
Micro services,Adopt,techniques,FALSE,"We are seeing an uptick in adoption of microservices as a technique for distributed system design, both in ThoughtWorks and in the wider community. Frameworks such as Dropwizard and practices like declarative provisioning point to a maturing of the technologies and tools. Avoiding the usual monolithic approach and being sympathetic to the need to replace parts of systems individually has important positive implications for the total cost of ownership of systems. We see this as having greatest impact in the mid-to-long term, specifically with respect to the two-to-five year rewrite cycle."
Open JDK 11/12 ,Adopt,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"<a href=""http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre7-downloads-1880261.html"">Java 6</a> is no longer current."
Jenkins,Adopt,tools,FALSE,"<a href=""https://jenkins.io/"">Jenkins</a> is an open source automation server, Jenkins provides hundreds of plugins to support building, deploying and automating any project."
TypeScript,Adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"<a href=""https://www.typescriptlang.org/"">TypeScript</a> is an interesting approach to bringing a new programming language to the browser. With TypeScript, the new language features compile down to normal JavaScript, and yet as a superset of JavaScript it does not feel like a completely new language. It does not represent an either-or proposition and it does not relegate JavaScript to an intermediate execution platform. Many of the language features are based on planned future extensions of JavaScript."
Nexus Repository,Adopt,tools,FALSE,"<a href=""https://www.sonatype.com/nexus-repository-sonatype"">Nexus</a> organise store and distribute software components"
Kafka Streams,Trial,languages & frameworks,FALSE,To consider as a part of the digital marketing platform in providing near realtime drops of key data from an online cache to the data warehouses
DevOps,Adopt,techniques,FALSE,
MongoDB,Adopt,platforms,TRUE,"<p>Currently we have a large MongoDB implementation in Production and all of the Test environments in CCP. It is owned and managed by MCSO. It is also supported 24x7.&nbsp;</p><strong>Recommended Courses</strong><p>Various training courses can be signed up for in the <a href=""http://university.mongodb.com/training/register?key=elxpfgg67y"">MongoDB University</a>&nbsp;Requires you to have a valid BT email address.</p><strong>Recommended Reading</strong><p><a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mastering-MongoDB-4-x-high-fault-tolerant/dp/1789617871/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=mongodb&amp;qid=1565080257&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1"">Mastering MongoDB 4.x</a></p>"
Virtual Box,Hold,tools,TRUE,"<a href=""https://www.virtualbox.org/"">VirtualBox</a> is a powerful x86 and AMD64/Intel64 virtualization product for enterprise as well as home use. Not only is VirtualBox an extremely feature rich, high performance product for enterprise customers, it is also the only professional solution that is freely available as Open Source Software under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2."
TLS1.2,Adopt,platforms,FALSE,
Decoupling secret management from source code,Assess,techniques,TRUE,"In previous Radars issues we mentioned tools such as git-crypt and Blackbox that allow us to keep secrets safe inside the source code. Decoupling secret management from source code is our way to remind technologists that there are other options for storing secrets. For example, HashiCorp vault, CI servers and configuration management tools provide mechanisms for storing secrets that are not linked to the source code of an application. Both approaches are viable and we recommend you use at least one of them in your projects."
Browser Stack,Adopt,techniques,FALSE,"<a href=""http://www.browserstack.com"">Browser Stack</a>Test your website for cross browser compatibility on real browsers. Instant access to multiple desktop and mobile browsers"
Agile JIRA,Adopt,tools,TRUE,
Python,Trial,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"Python is a clear and powerful object-oriented programming language, comparable to Perl, Ruby, Scheme, or Java. "
SonarQube,Adopt,tools,FALSE,"Code Quality tooling with <a href=""https://www.sonarqube.org/"">SonrCube</a>."
Selenium,Adopt,tools,FALSE,
Swagger,Adopt,tools,TRUE,"Providing interactive API documentation using the OpenAPI Specification and the <a href=""https://swagger.io/"">Swagger</a> toolset for RESTful API documentation."
Gatling,Adopt,tools,TRUE,"The <a href=""http://gatling.io/"">Gatling</a> load and performance test tool should be assessed as a tool to allow developers to quickly and simply assess the basic performance characteristics of their code ahead of more formal load/soak testing."
Reactive / event driven solutions,Adopt,techniques,TRUE,"Where appropriate, we should be moving away from wasteful ""thread per request"" architectures to more reactive architectures. These should use non-blocking IO and be stream based. This is a fast moving area but given our use of Spring, we should assess the <a href=""https://projectreactor.io/"">Reactor</a> project and Spring <a href=""http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.0.0.RC2/spring-framework-reference/web.html#web-reactive"">WebFlux</a> (which uses Reactor internally)."
Functional programming techniques,Adopt,techniques,TRUE,"The rise of languages on the JVM with strong functional programming support (such as Scala and Kotlin) has, at last, driven good support for fucntional programming idioms into the Java language (as of JDK 8). We should be adopting functional programming idioms where expliclty supported by the JDK e.g. higher order functions, working with collections as streams etc as well as adopting functional idioms not directly supported by the language e.g. greatly enhanced use of immutable variables and avoiding ""side effects""."
